# AdEase-Wikipedia-Page-View-Forecasting
Time series forecasting project on Wikipedia page views using SARIMAX. Includes EDA, seasonality analysis, stationarity checks, model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, MAPE), confidence intervals, and insights on traffic spikes and trends.

# Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting Wikipedia page views using time series analysis. The goal is to understand traffic patterns, capture trends and seasonality, and evaluate how well a forecasting model performs in predicting future visits.
We use the SARIMAX model to analyze historical page view data and assess prediction accuracy using standard error metrics.

# Objectives
Understand trends, seasonality, and volatility in page views
Make the time series stationary (de-trending & de-seasonalizing)
Build and evaluate a SARIMAX forecasting model
Analyze model performance and limitations

# Methodology 
1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Trend and seasonality visualization
- Weekly and yearly patterns

2.Time Series Processing
- Stationarity checks
- De-trending and de-seasonalizing

3.Modeling
- SARIMAX model for forecasting
- Confidence interval analysis

4.Evaluation Metrics
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
